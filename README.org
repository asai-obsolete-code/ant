| Mouse3 Drag        | put ant's food     |


*** Attention

Do not try to put a wall after you've started running!
It may cause a severe problem in the program and require you to
restart the lisp backend.

*** Notice

=cl-gtk-gtk2= takes a long long time to compile and load the image.
Go take cookies and a cup of coffee during the compilation time.
Those ants would appreciate it.
